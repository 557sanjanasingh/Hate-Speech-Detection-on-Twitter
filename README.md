# Hate-Speech-Detection-on-Twitter

In this project, we start by presenting the existing problem which comes with freedom of speech on the Internet and the misuse of social media platforms like twitter. These problems become an integral part of the motivation. We conduct a comprehensive and thorough research work by referring to the existing works in this field and coming up with a proposed solution for the problem.
